<p>Brexit, and now this. If England wins the EURO2020/1, how will Boris exploit this situation? Will the English glory combined with Brexit propel Boris onwards or will this perhaps be the cause of Scottish independence?</p>
<p>Sebastian did not believe in England, and has paid the price. Scott is now in the lead, by a 21 point margin. Robert remain first in pursuit, and he is still within the 200 point margin that might tip the scale in case of a correct winner prediction.</p>
