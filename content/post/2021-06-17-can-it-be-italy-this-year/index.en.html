<p>Øyvind, Jonathan, Marina, Philipp B and Philipp L. have all Italy as champions. At the moment, this outcome looks quite likely. They are already through to the next round as the first team.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s game was so highly anticipated that it made little impact on the standings. Sebastian widened the gap with two points as he was closer to the result than Scott.</p>
<p>A special shout out to Tor for getting the result spot on.</p>
