The group stage is over, and it is time to look at things. First is the number of goals scored so far in this tournament. Where do we stand?

In all 36 games together, there has been 94 goals so far. This is the exact number predicted by none. Marit, Ã˜ivind, Elin and myself are within the VARgin of error (+/- 3 goals). Our common average is 86, which is not to bad To find yourself, hover over the graph below. 

```{r plot, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

library(plotly)

data<-read.csv("E:/Users/hs/Dropbox/diverse/EM2021/py/test.csv", fileEncoding = 'utf8')

gg_data <- data %>% 
  select(-X, -Observed) %>% 
  mutate(Match = Match -8) %>% 
  pivot_longer(!Match, names_to = "name", values_to = "Goals")

gg_observed <- data %>% 
  select(Match, Observed) %>% 
  mutate(Match = Match -8) %>% 
  pivot_longer(!Match, names_to = "name", values_to = "Goals")

test <-ggplot(gg_data, aes(x = Match, y = Goals, color = name)) + 
         geom_line() +
         geom_line(data = gg_observed, aes(x = Match, y = Goals), color = "Black", size = 3) +
         theme_light() +
         theme(legend.position = "none")
