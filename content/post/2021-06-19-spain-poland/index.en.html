<p>A brace of own goals put an imprortant question to rest. There are already more own goals in this championship than the previous, so 30 points are awarded to the 7 individuals that predicted this outcome. Smugness is probably in order, as the rest of us must work on our excuses.</p>
<p>The color Blue.</p>
<p>Five individuals had a draw in this game, and are greatly rewarded. Three of these are permanent members of the STV betting committee. It is sometimes hard to phantom why we donâ€™t win money more often.</p>
<p>The rest of us can forget about this game altogether.</p>
