<p>The first finalist is Italy.</p>
<p>Scott very correctly predicted that the semi final would be Denmark - England, and has as such lept above and beyond Sebastian with a 56 point lead. Robert did the very same and is cathcing up fast, but he still has a distance to cover, as he remain 70 points behind Sebastian but only 13 points behind Jacob. Jacob is also catching up with Sebastian.</p>
<p>There is a sizeable gap down to the rest, but Ã˜ivind deserves praise for correctly predicting this semi-final as well.</p>
