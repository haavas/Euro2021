<p>Italy and Wales are through to the knockout stage. Switzerland could go through as one of the better third placed teams. This fact should in a perfect world lead to the distribution of the first points from the knockout stage, but these will have to wait until the conclusion of the group stage.</p>
<p>Sebastian and Scott are now run-away leaders. Sebastian is a stunning 70 points ahead of Jacob. The gap to Scott has increased to 14 points.</p>
<p>Marina, Jan Erling and Linda deserve praise for an evening well predicted.</p>
<p>The Welsh got a red card, which brings the tally up to two.</p>
