<p>North Macedonia and Ukraine are out.</p>
<p>Austria are through, to face everyoneâ€™s favorites Italy. The Dutch will, at the time of writing, meet Portugal. In their deams, they will meet Hungary, but that looks unlikely.</p>

<p>Sebastian is now 10 points ahead of Scott. 10 points. Scott nailed both of these games 100%.</p>
