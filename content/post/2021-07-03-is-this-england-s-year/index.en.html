<p>England’s defence has so far been watertight, and Pickford is so far the only keeper to keep a clean sheet. Denmark is the other team in the second semi final, somewthing which is not at all inconsequential for our competition.</p>
<p>Scott very correctly predicted that the semi final would be Denmark - England, and has as such lept above and beyond Sebastian with a 56 point lead. Robert did the very same and is cathcing up fast, but he still has a distance to cover, as he remain 70 points behind Sebastian but only 13 points behind Jacob. Jacob is also catching up with Sebastian.</p>
<p>There is a sizeable gap down to the rest, but Øivind deserves praise for correctly predicting this semi-final as well.</p>
