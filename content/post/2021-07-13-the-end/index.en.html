<div id="the-winner-is-øyvind-colbjørnsen" class="section level1">
<h1>The winner is Øyvind Colbjørnsen!</h1>
<p>Italy’s victory changed quite a lot, and a string of qualitative points provided a solid reshuffle as well. The top three, Øyvind, Philipp L. and Marina, correctly predicted Italy’s win. Well done!</p>
<p>Øyvind won with a margin of 37 points, which corresponds to more than one correct answer. Phillip beat Marina with a most slim margin of 10 points.</p>
<p>Scott and Sebastian had a very thight race up until the final, but Scott ended up 56 points ahead of Sebastian.</p>
