<p>Penalty shootouts are won by the initiators. So, once the coin is tossed, the outcome is decided. Or something.</p>
<p>Not many had Spain in the Semis, but one of them is Sebastian, so we have a change in the lead! Sebastian is now ahead. Jacob is back in third, pushing Robert down to forth.</p>
<p>Ã˜yvind, Philipp L., Anne-Kathrin, Dag Harald, Dagfinn and Marit all had Spain through and is well rewarded for this.</p>
